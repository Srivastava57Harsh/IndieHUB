# ðŸ’¡  Problem Statement

- In Today's World we witness the lack of opportunities for several artists in several fields, talking about the the singers, we see that even the talented singers find it difficult in portraying their talent in the public, for publishing a mere piece of art, they need to struggle a lot, they need to go through the process of all copyright credits and conditions led down by the the publishing platforms, lastly they are forced to give N percentage of their gain from the platform as a part of commission. All these are concrete barriers in the life of newly emerging talented singers, either they lack with money or with some or the other discrepancies. To avoid this hassle in their life, we come here with platform void of all the problems told above.âœ¨ðŸ”¥

# ðŸ’ª Goals

- Use a full fledged working platform which helps small scale artists and creating our custom dynamic music player as well as having a foolproof IPFS connection.

# ðŸ’» Tech Stack

- Next.js
- Solidity


#   Challenges we ran into

- FRONTEND: The biggest challenge was to create a full fledged working dynamic music player with all the functionalities, we could have easily used any library available on the internet but we thought of creating our own playlist dynamic track as well as a dynamic music player. Lastly working with Textloop was some sort of hinderance for us.
- BACKEND: Connecting the IPFS with dynamic playlist was a big challenge and so was to update it.
